Javascript TDD with Jasmine
===========================

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

jasmine-jquery
--------------

jasmine-jquery provides two extensions for Jasmine JavaScript Testing Framework:

* a set of custom matchers for jQuery framework
* an API for handling HTML, CSS, and JSON fixtures in your specs

There are problems with the Cross domain policy under Chrome (and other browsers), to solve it you can run the script using a web server.

My solution is **node.js**; install it and then execute:
```sh
node webserver.js
```

Katas
-----

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

The term was probably first coined by [Dave Thomas][], co-author of the book [The Pragmatic Programmer][], in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.

As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published [21 different katas][].

###Hello World

A "Hello world" program is a computer program that outputs "Hello world" on a display device.

Because it is typically one of the simplest programs possible in most programming languages, it is by tradition often used to illustrate to beginners the most basic syntax of a programming language.

It is also used to verify that a language or system is operating correctly.

###Fizz buzz

Fizz buzz (also known as bizz buzz, or simply buzz) is a group word game for children to teach them about division.

Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
